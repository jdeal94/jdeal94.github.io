	<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>From the time I was old enough to walk I began showing a considerable interest in the game of basketball. 
		I had a little plastic goal that couldn’t have stood taller than about 3 feet, 
		and I’d spend hours shooting my little Styrofoam ball into the hoop. 
		I pretty much lived and breathed basketball from that age up until the time 
		I left for college. When I was eight years old, I even told my mom that I was going to 
		make it into the NBA and that I was going to do whatever it took to make my dream a reality. 
		I had hundreds of replica jerseys of all my favorite players and watched them religiously with my dad up until 
		the wee hours of the night. As I got older and realized that no matter how hard I worked, 
		I wouldn’t be able to overcome my lack of size and athleticism, I began directing my energy to other areas 
		such as hiking, fishing, and various outdoor hobbies. I also switched to a more academic approach of 
		finding success as I realized I was pretty capable of doing well in school. 
		Then, I enrolled at UGA and in the chaos of college life I have since all but forgotten 
		my first love, and my first passion. So, this webpage is dedicated to that first passion, 
		the game I fell in love with that as of late, has fallen to the backburner.  </p>

<p><I> As a prudent basketball fan, it's important to know the stats. If you're like me,
whenever a argument might arise about who the best player of all time is, or who the best 3-point 
shooter of all time is, etc; you always want to be armed with the statistics to back up your argument. Here's
a link to the site I get most of my information from.</I></p>
